# Skin-Lesion-Classification
This project is related to medical imaging and classification of skin disease called melanoma using classical as well and computer vision techniques.
The increasing incidences of melanoma has recently promoted the development of computer-aided
diagnosis systems for the classification of dermoscopic images. The PH² dataset has been developed
for research and benchmarking purposes, in order to facilitate comparative studies on both segmentation
and classification algorithms of dermoscopic images. PH² is a dermoscopic image database acquired at
the Dermatology Service of Hospital Pedro Hispano, Matosinhos, Portugal.
The dermoscopic images were obtained at the Dermatology Service of Hospital Pedro Hispano
(Matosinhos, Portugal) under the same conditions through Tuebinger Mole Analyzer system using a
magnification of 20x. They are 8-bit RGB color images with a resolution of 768x560 pixels.
This image database contains a total of 200 dermoscopic images of melanocytic lesions, including 80
common nevi, 80 atypical nevi, and 40 melanomas. The PH² database includes medical annotations of
all the images namely medical segmentation of the lesion, clinical and histological diagnosis and the
assessment of several dermoscopic criteria (colors; pigment network; dots/globules; streaks; regression
areas; blue-whitish veil).
